    refuses with ``TooManyConnectionsError``. That surfaces wherever the next

    ``TooManyConnectionsError`` means the pool's ceiling is above the server's.

    Not clamped, deliberately. Pool sizes are fixed when the engine is created,
    which happens at import — before any connection exists to ask the server
    with — and ``engine`` / ``async_session`` are imported by name in ~150 places,

    fell back to ``PrintArchive.filament_used_grams`` — the sum over EVERY plate of
    the source 3MF (right for the archive card / project rollup, wrong for one
    printed plate). So each printed plate of a 22-plate file logged the full ~12 kg,
    inflating lifetime / user / project / filament stats by the plate count. The

    Only completed rows whose stored grams EXACTLY equal the archive's whole-file

    rounded spool-delta sum) and partial-progress rows (scaled to progress) never

    whole so it stays consistent with the corrected grams. Runs AFTER the #2603
    archive plate_id backfill so ``print_archives.plate_id`` is populated.

    Gated to run **exactly once** via a settings flag. This is not merely for

    always sends one), and for it the plate estimate legitimately equals the
    whole-file value — so those rows match the signature on every boot. Without
    the one-shot gate we would re-parse every single-plate 3MF on the print log at

    Only rows that are still NULL are touched, and only from the 3MF already on
    disk -- nothing is invented and nothing already recorded is overwritten. An
    archive whose file is gone (a no-3MF fallback, or one whose 3MF has been
    cleaned up) is skipped and stays NULL, which is the honest answer.

    Gated to run exactly once via a settings flag, like #2614's repair. The
    work itself is repeatable -- it only fills NULLs -- but the rows it cannot
    fill are exactly the ones it would re-open on every boot, and that set grows
    with print history.

# Historical failure-reason labels, mapped to the canonical key that replaced
# them (issue #2974).
#
# Three writers used to put three different spellings of one cause into
# ``failure_reason``: the backend wrote English display labels, older versions
# of the archive editor wrote the *translated* label in whatever locale that
# user was running, and two stale-archive paths wrote English prose sentences.
# The Failure Analysis widget groups on the raw column, so one real cause could
# occupy several buckets -- measured on a live install before this landed: 91
# rows reading "User cancelled" beside 1 reading "userCancelled", which in an
# English UI rendered as the same words twice with different counts.
#
# This is deliberately a FROZEN SNAPSHOT rather than something derived from the
# locale files at run time. It maps values as they were written historically; if
# a translation is reworded tomorrow, the old string is still what sits in the
# database and still has to map. Regenerating it from ``en.ts`` and friends
# would silently stop recognising the very rows it exists to convert.
#
# Every label here resolves to exactly one key -- verified across all 14 locales
# with no collisions -- so the conversion is exact rather than a best guess. A
# value that is NOT in this map (free text from an older build, a translation
# since edited) is deliberately left alone: it already renders through the
# ``defaultValue`` fallback in both the editor and the Statistics breakdown, and
# guessing at it would be worse than leaving one honest string in its own bucket.

    A Bambu roll arrives on the 250 g Low Temp spool, but the lookup that gave
    an auto-added spool its ``core_weight`` asked for the first row whose name
    starts "Bambu Lab" and took whatever came back. There are three, and which
    one is first is up to the database: SQLite returns insertion order in
    practice, Postgres promises nothing once the table has seen an update. So
    the same roll could be recorded with a 216 g High Temp tare on one install
    and correctly on another, and the reporting instance here got 216.

    The tare is not cosmetic. A spool weighed on SpoolBuddy has its remaining
    filament worked out as ``scale reading - core_weight``, so a 34 g low tare
    credits the roll with 34 g of filament that is not there and writes a
    ``weight_used`` 34 g short. That error is a constant: every later print
    adds to ``weight_used`` on top of it, so adding the difference back is an
    exact repair however much has been printed since. Only rows that have
    actually been weighed carry it -- a spool that was never on the scale has
    a ``weight_used`` derived from the AMS remaining percentage, which the tare
    never touched.

    Which rows: ``data_origin = 'rfid_auto'`` narrows it to spools this code
    path created, and a ``core_weight`` matching one of the *other* Bambu
    catalogue rows is the signature of the broken lookup. Reading the weights
    out of the catalogue rather than hardcoding 216 and 253 keeps it correct on
    an install whose catalogue has been edited.

    One case cannot be told apart and is stated rather than hidden: a user who
    moved an RFID roll onto a genuine High Temp spool and set its tare to 216
    by hand looks identical to a row the lookup got wrong, and is normalised
    with them. Keying on ``core_weight_catalog_id IS NULL`` instead would not
    have rescued them -- the spool form's weight picker auto-selects the only
    catalogue row matching the weight and writes its id on the next save, so
    that column says only whether the form was ever opened.

    """Build variant groups from the slice provenance already on disk (#671 / #2570).

    ``sliced_from_library_file_id`` has been stamped into ``file_metadata`` by the
    Slice button (routes/library.py) and the pipeline runner (routes/pipeline_runs.py)
    since those features shipped, and until now nothing ever read it back — the
    link existed but was inert. This promotes it to real group membership so an
    existing library arrives with its slice sets already grouped instead of
    requiring the user to re-declare by hand what Bambuddy itself recorded.

    Only sources with **two or more** sliced children carrying **distinct**
    ``sliced_for_model`` values produce a group:

    - Fewer than two candidates is not a choice, and a one-member group would
      change nothing at print time while creating a row per sliced file in every
      library on earth.
    - Two children sliced for the same printer are not alternatives — the
      resolver has no basis to prefer one, so grouping them would turn a
      harmless duplicate into an arbitrary pick. Those sources are skipped
      whole; the user can still group them by hand and choose an order.

    The unsliced source file is deliberately not a member. It has no
    ``sliced_for_model``, so it can never be a dispatch candidate; showing it
    alongside its variants is a File Manager listing concern, which is out of
    scope.

    Idempotent: only files with no group yet are considered, so a re-run after a
    partial apply resumes rather than duplicating, and a user who has since
    ungrouped files by hand does not get them silently regrouped.
