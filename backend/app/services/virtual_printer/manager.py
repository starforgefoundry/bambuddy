    BambuStudio/OrcaSlicer resolves the physical AMS tray for each filament

    manual per-filament AMS-slot assignment dialog — and embeds the result as
    ``ams_mapping`` (``list[int]``, position = slot_id-1, value = global tray
    ID) directly in the MQTT ``project_file`` command. Confirmed by wire
    capture: the field is present and already in the exact shape
    ``PrintQueueItem.ams_mapping`` expects.

    The VP-queue path previously never read this — every queued print had the
    scheduler re-derive a mapping from just the 3MF's static type/color at
    dispatch time (`PrintScheduler._compute_ams_mapping_for_printer`), discarding
    the slicer's already-correct, live-resolved pick. That re-derivation can
    land on the wrong physical spool whenever the file's type+color match
    isn't unique (e.g. two spools of the same color) or the file's own
    filament-slot color wasn't what the user actually intended for that
    particular print. Capturing it here — mirroring the existing
    ``nozzle_mapping`` passthrough for H2C rack-swap models (#1780) — lets the
    scheduler's "already resolved, don't touch it" branch in
    ``_ensure_ams_mapping`` use the slicer's own choice unchanged.

    That branch skipping ``_compute_ams_mapping_for_printer`` is also what
    makes this a trade rather than a pure win: ``prefer_lowest_filament``, its
    AMS-filament-backup gate (#1766), the inventory-remain overrides and the
    per-slot force-color overrides all live inside that function. Callers are
    responsible for the gating — this parser only says what the slicer sent.

        Bambu Studio 2.7.x flipped the order to FTP → FTP → MQTT project_file,

        ``on_file_received`` and overwrites the state back to PREPARE. The

        send modal sits at "Downloading" until the VP is restarted (#1658).

        Re-firing FINISH after a short delay closes the gap: the slicer sees
        the synthetic PREPARE in the project_file ack (and likely one PREPARE
        push on the 1 Hz cycle), then the next push carries FINISH and the
        modal releases. Proxy mode is exempt — there the real printer drives
        the state through the bridge and a synthetic FINISH would clobber a
        real PREPARE/RUNNING transition coming back from the printer.
